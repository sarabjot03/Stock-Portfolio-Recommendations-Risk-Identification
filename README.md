## Project Description
The stock market is a dynamic ecosystem where individual and institutional investors buy and sell securities. The primary goal for any investor is to achieve capital gains while managing risk, which often involves making complex decisions based on incomplete or rapidly changing information. Various factors influence stock prices, including macroeconomic data, corporate performance, and global events. 
Industry Survey: According to a 2023 report by McKinsey & Company, 35% of financial institutions now integrate AI-driven tools for portfolio management. A survey from Deloitte revealed that 40% of asset management firms are focusing on incorporating machine learning into risk assessment frameworks.
### Current Trends and Technologies
•	Time Series Forecasting: Financial analysts have traditionally relied on statistical models like ARIMA to predict price movements. However, machine learning models such as LSTM networks have emerged as more accurate methods for time series forecasting, capturing non-linear patterns in stock data.
•	Reinforcement Learning: RL is being adopted to create models that dynamically adjust to market changes. This contrasts with static models by learning from interactions with the financial environment and improving decision-making strategies over time.
This project is motivated by the increasing need to use machine learning to analyse the various factors, helping investors to predict future movements and create optimized portfolios.

## Installation
This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
To run this project, download the project files and run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
After installing the necessary libraries, open the Jupyter Notebook. You can view the code and output for each cell and run each cell individually. To run all cells at once, click Cell -> Run All in the menu.
Features
The project consists of several components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset to ensure it’s suitable for training a model. This includes removing outliers, handling missing values, and handling duplicates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming the raw data into a format that is more suitable for modelling. This includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling highly correlated features.
- **Model Training**: Training the machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset. This includes splitting the dataset, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model. This includes using metrics and achieving a high accuracy rate.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained and evaluated model to predict new data.
- **User Interface**: Developing a simple web interface where investors can input some parameters to predict future movements and create optimized portfolios.
